## This folder contains the code and files for the LSTM models used in this project 
### different LSTM models were developed, one for fatigue detection, one for eye closure detection and own for yawn detection
The folders contain the final files along with the training code/data 

[Eye_Closure_Detect](Eye_Closure_Detect): LSTM Model for Eye closure detection <br>
[Fatigue_Detect](Fatigue_Detect): Model for Fatigue Detection <br>
[Yawn_Detect](Yawn_Detect): Model for yawn detection <br>
