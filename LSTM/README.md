## This folder contains the code and files for the LSTM models used in this project 
# different LSTM models were developed, one for fatigue detection, one for eye closure detection and own for yawn detection
The folders contain the final files along with the training code/data 

[Eye Closure Detect](Eye Closure Detect): LSTM Model for Eye closure detection <br>
[Fatigue Detect](Fatigue Detect): Model for Fatigue Detection <br>
[Yawn Detect](Yawn Detect): Model for yawn detection <br>
