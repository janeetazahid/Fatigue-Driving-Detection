## This folder contains the code and files associated with the LSTM model that detects extended eye closure 
Training was done in Google Colab. "Extended eye closure" refers to when the drivers eyes are closed longer than an average blink would last which indicates fatigue

[model_eye](model_eye): Final LSTM model <br>
[LSTM_eye.xlsx](LSTM_eye.xlsx): Data used to train the model <br>
[data.zip](data.zip): raw data obtained after annotating vidoes <br>
[eye_lstm_train.py](eye_lstm_train.py): Python code for training model <br>
